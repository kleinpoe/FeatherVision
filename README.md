# Feather Vision - An automatic Bird watching Camera

Welcome to my little bird watching project. This is a Raspberry Pi 5 Based camera which automatically records clips of birds (or also other objects). I have used it for a few years now (originally with some Pi 4-based prototype) and it brought me such joy that I want to share the code for it.

Best watch this video that shows the features:
